about_text = """# Why Build This?

I chose to build this admittedly simple web app for a few reasons:

1. I wanted to explore different ways to put Python web apps into production. This project was primarily built using `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Bokeh`, and `Panel`, and I had not tried publishing something on `heroku` before. 

2. I've been reading `Financial Theory with Python` by Yves Hilpisch, and while the first chapters were very educational (especially for someone with little-to-no formal background in finance like myself), I couldn't think of how to apply what I was learning.

But I also think that this project has some 'added value' compared to the forecasts seen on platforms like `Wealthsimple`: First, being able to compare two scenarios (sets of parameters) side-by-side is instructive in itself! It could, for instance, demonstrate the aggregated difference of saving 50 vs 100 dollars per month over 20 years. Secondly, I believe that `Wealthsimple` would benefit from adding personal milestones/highlights to their visualization like what was done in this project. These highlights could definitely keep someone motivated to keep saving spare income, which I believe to be a worthwhile endeavour. From a business standpoint, these milestones (and the extra source of motivation) would most likely increase user retention and daily visits.
