# Journal
I originally considered this project as an opportunity to finally play with `Voila` and review the basics of `Bokeh`'s interactive functionalities. However, I learned that `Voila` does not support some of the `Bokeh` features I intended to use. So the project pivoted away from `Voila` towards `Panel`.

# Tech Stack
- Panel
- Bokeh
