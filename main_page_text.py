motivation = """# What's the Point?

It is generally a good idea to save spare income. People often save their money for specific goal(s) like a financially secure retirement. Two fairly prominent aspects of long-term goals (like saving for your retirement) are that 

1. They tend to involve larger sums of money, and 
2. People have more to work towards those goals than they do for short-term goals. 

These two factors can lead to procrastination and the misconception that you can only make progress if you have a large amount of money to contribute to your savings account. This web app aims to demonstrate quite the opposite: that making small, regular contributions can lead to meaningful progress, and how you could leverage compound interest by placing your savings in low-risk investment (and the sooner you do so, the better)!
